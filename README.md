Business

Proposal to analyze data of a bank –



Introduction 

    The project is about the reduction of churn rate of credit card customers of a 150-year-old bank called Wells Fargo.
    According to Gary W. Class, senior vice president for Wells Fargo, it pays to know the customer’s channel preferences, and to predict which products they might need.
    The bank was able to reduce the customer churn rate with a lead analysis program that took both of those variables and more into account. The bank started out by studying data about the customer’s behaviors and their interests, patterns, etc.



Impact Hypothesis

The desired business impact is to reduce customer loss and reduce the monetary loss of the bank.
